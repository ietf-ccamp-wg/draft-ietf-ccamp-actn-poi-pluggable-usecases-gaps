       draft-poidt-ccamp-actn-poi-pluggable-usecases-gaps-latest

Abstract

   This document provides general overarching guidelines for control and
   management of packet over optical converged networks with coherent
   pluggables and focuses on operators' use cases and network scenarios.
   It provides a set of use cases which are needed for the control and
   management of the packet over optical networks which comprise devices
   with mixes of packet and optical functions where the optical
   functions may be provided on coherent pluggables.  The document
   provides a gap analysis to solve the use cases.

2.  Introduction

   Packet traffic has been transferred over optical networks for many
   years blending the benefits of optical transmission and switching
   with packet switching.  Optical systems have been separated from
   packet systems, both of which have had specific dedicated devices.
   In many existing network deployments, the packet and the optical
   networks are engineered, operated and controlled independently.  The
   operation of these packet and optical networks is often siloed which
   results in non-optimal and inefficient networking.  Both packet and
   optical systems have had relatively independent evolution.  Optical
   systems have been developed with increasing capacity especially with
   the emergence of coherent optical techniques.

   Optical component design has continued to improve density to the
   point where a whole coherent optical terminal system that use to
   require many circuit packs can now fit onto a single small form
   factor "coherent plug".  Placing coherent plugs in a device with
   packet functions can reduce network cost, power consumption and
   footprint as well as improve data transfer rates, reduce latency and
   expand capacity (note that in some cases, other engineering and
   deployment considerations still lead to separate packet and optical
   solutions).

   Optical transmission/switching is analogue and requires complex and
   holistic control.  Consequently, coordination of control of the
   coherent plugs (in a device with packet functions) with the control
   of the rest of the optical network is highly desirable as this best
   enables robust network functionality and simplifies network
   operations.

   The combination of these above trends along with the desire to select
   best in breed components has led to the emergence of open optical
   plugs that offer a standard bus for traffic and that use CMIS
   [OIF-CMIS], extended with Coherent CMIS, between coherent pluggables
   and host device.  These plugs are such that a plug from vendor X can
   be installed in vendor Y's device with packet functions etc.

   An architecture analysis has been carried out by the MANTRA sub-group
   in the OOPT / TIP group (Open Optical & Packet Transport / Telecom
   Infra Project)
   [MANTRA-whitepaper-IPoWDM-convergent-SDN-architecture].

   This document provides guidellines for control and management of
   packet over optical converged networks and it is divided into
   following sections:

   *  Section 3 Packet over optical converged network context

   *  Section 4 Network Scenarios

   *  Section 5 Use cases for the control and management of Packet over
      Optical Converged Networks

   *  Section 5 Gap analysis

3.  Packet over Optical Converged Network Context

   A packet over optical network represents an efficient paradigm that
   harnesses the power of both packet-switching and optical
   technologies.  In this approach, the overlay IP or MPLS packets are
   transmitted through an underlying optical network.  The fusion of
   packet and optical networks offer a host of advantages, including
   accelerated data transfer rates, diminished latency, and expanded
   network capacity.

   In general, two deployment models can be used to deploy the packet
   over optical networks:

   *  Traditional architecture deployment model

   *  Deployment model with coherent pluggables

3.1.  Traditional Architecture Deployment Model

   The traditional architecture involves separation of the packet
   network from the optical network as shown in Figure 1.  In
   traditional approach, the packet layer responsible for routing and
   forwarding is decoupled from the underlying optical transport layer.
   This approach offers several benefits, including the ability to scale
   each layer independently, optimize resource utilization, and simplify
   network management through centralized software control.

   Disaggregation enables network operators to choose best-of-breed
   components for each layer, fostering innovation and competition in
   the networking industry.  However, implementing and managing a
   disaggregated network also comes with challenges related to
   interoperability, integration, and maintaining end-to-end performance
   across the various layers.

                                   Model

3.2.  Deployment Model with Coherent Pluggables

   The second approach is to take advantage of the small implementation
   footprint of the xPonder functions and to deploy these functions on a
   single small form factor plug (aka Coherent pluggables) and then
   place plugs directly into the packet devices as shown in Figure 2(A).
   Placing this small form factor pluggable in a device with packet
   functions can reduce network cost, power consumption and footprint
   (when these benefits are not outweighed by other engineering
   considerations).  Depending on the application, distance between
   packet devices, quality of fibers and so on it might be that there is
   no need for a ROADM network, i.e., direct connectivity between packet
   devices via plugs is possible.

   By incorporating coherent plugs into routers, network operators can
   achieve higher data rates, greater spectral efficiency, and improved
   tolerance to optical impairments.  This is especially valuable in
   scenarios where traditional electronic signaling might encounter
   limitations.  Coherent plugs enable routers to leverage advanced
   modulation schemes, digital signal processing, and error correction
   techniques, enhancing their ability to handle complex optical
   signals.

   One of the key advantages of using coherent plugs in routers is the
   potential to bridge the gap between long-haul and metro networks,
   providing a seamless and efficient transition of data across various
   network segments.  This technology can contribute to the evolution of
   high-speed data centers, interconnection between data centers, and
   the overall growth of data-intensive applications.

   as noted above, for some use-cases when the distance between packet
   devices is short and optical power of pluggables are enough, the
   photonics devices might not be needed as shown in Figure 2(B).

   where the optical network contains both coherent pluggables and
   xPonders as shown in Figure 3.

4.  Network Scenarios

   This section provides a set of packet over optical network scenarios,
   starting with the most common ones.

4.1.  Scenario A - High capacity point to point connection over
      dedicated direct fiber

   As depicted in Figure 4, this scenario considers a point-to-point
   optical service over a short distance (e.g., up to 100 km) using
   dedicated fiber.

   Note that there is no amplification and no protection in this
   scenario.

4.2.  Scenario B - High capacity point to point over shared fiber

   This scenario extends Figure 4 by making more efficient use of the
   deployed fiber infrastructure.

   As shown in Figure 5, this scenario considers a point-to-point
   optical service over a short distance (e.g., up to 100 km) using a
   physical optical network with DWDM filters and amplifiers.  Several
   point-to-point connections can be multiplexed from the same packet
   devices.

   Note that there is no protection in this scenario.

      shared meshed network

   This scenario extends Figure 5 by making more flexible use of the
   fiber network infrastructure.

   As shown in Figure 6, this scenario considers a point-to-point
   optical service over a metro/regional network (e.g., up to 500 km).
   The metro/regional network contains DWDM filters, amplifiers and
   optical switching.

   Note that there is no resilience in this scenario.  (CHECK AS

5.  Operators' Use cases

   This section provides a set of packet over optical general use cases
   which are applicable to any network topologies in Section 4 and both
   for multi-layer networks using or not coherent pluggables in the
   routers.  These use cases are presented following current operators’
   priorities order.

   The use cases a generally applicable for both the traditional packet
   over optical integration based on grey interfaces in the IP routers
   and use of transponders/muxponders in the optical domain and for the
   packet over optical integration considering coherent DWDM pluggables
   in the IP routers over a media channel/Network Media channel in the
   optical domain.  For clarification purposes, the mention ‘valid for
   both’ has been added in the name of each use case else ‘valid for
   coherent pluggable’ when the use case is specific to the coherent
   pluggable approach.

5.1.  End-to-end multi-layer visibility and management (valid for both)

5.1.1.  End-to-end multi-layer network and service topology discovery
        and inventory

   The objective of the use case is to have a full end-to-end multi-
   layer view from all the layers and their inter-dependencies: service
   layer (e.g.  L3VPN/L2VPN), transport layer (RSVP-TE, SR-TE), IP layer
   (IGP), Ethernet layer, OTN L1 layer (optional), photonic L0 layer
   (OCh, OMS, OTS and fibre).  The discovery process, in addition to the
   layered logical view, includes the inventory discovery by each
   controller and exposure to the MDSC of the required information for a
   complete end-to-end multi-layer view of the network.

5.1.1.1.  Coherent DWDM pluggable insertion in the router linecard port
          ('valid for coherent pluggable')

   Once a pluggable module is inserted in the proper linecard port, the
   host device must recognise the hardware component (e.g. 400G ZR+
   pluggable module) and expose its attributes and capabilities to the
   controller.  For example, ZR+ modules can share the operational-mode-
   IDs supported that summarize the most important pluggable
   characteristics (such as FEC type, modulation format, baud rate, bit
   rate, etc.).  If the hardware component has been successfully
   recognised, the host device is then ready to create and expose the
   necessary logical arrangements.

   Several coherent pluggables seem to come with a factory default set
   of provisioning parameters (e.g. default channel number, default
   launched power, default application code id, laser-on, admin-state
   enabled etc.).  This factory default set of provisioning parameters
   varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.  This can allow a
   “plug&play” mode of operation over point-to-point connections (e.g.
   single wavelength over dark fiber) of course limited to bookended
   solutions from the same Vendor and same factory default provisioning
   parameters.  However, when the optical connection between two
   pluggables is targeted to run over a DWDM Open Line System (OLS)
   network, optical validation & planning step is first required to
   determine the right target provisioning parameters values to be set
   in the pluggables before interconnecting them to their respective
   ROADM to avoid to impact any other existing optical channels already
   up and running in the OLS network.  It is critical for operators to
   have the same kind of commissioning phase independently of the
   deployment scenario: point-to-point vs ROADM meshed OLS network.  As
   a consequence, the use of factory default provisioning parameters may
   be fine but they shall always be able to be overwritten through
   router CLI or through Packet PNC to another set of default
   provisioning parameters defined by the operator that will change from
   pluggable to pluggable when deployed over an OLS network.  A reset of
   the coherent pluggable (through router CLI or through Packet PNC or
   due to a power off/on) shall always go back to this operator’s
   default set of provisioning parameters where, for example, the laser-
   state shall be ‘Off’ and admin-state ‘disabled’.

5.1.1.2.  Inventory of Coherent DWDM pluggable ('valid for coherent
          pluggable').

   The domain controller exposes to the MDSC hardware inventory
   information of the devices under its supervision.  For full router
   inventory (linecards, ports, etc.) see draft-ietf-ivy-network-
   inventory-yang.  In addition, it has to include the coherent
   pluggable transceiver capabilities.  These include, for instance,
   operational-modes supported (ITU-T application codes, organizational
   modes), min/max central-frequency range supported, min/max output
   power supported, min/max received power supported etc.  In case of
   discovery of any HW mismatch between coherent DWDM pluggable and
   router linecard port capabilities the controller shall report HW
   mismatch alarm to MDSC.  An example is a linecard multi-rate port vs
   coherent DWDM pluggable with only one client/line rate (e.g.
   1x400GE).

5.1.1.3.  Coherent pluggable OTSi service discovery information ('valid
          for coherent pluggable').

   Once a router-to-router connection with coherent pluggables has been
   created over a Network Media Channel in the optical Line system, then
   it is required to expose the OTSi service.  The relevant OTSi
   information could be nominal-central-frequency, tx-output-power,
   operational-mode-ID, operational-status, admin-status etc.

5.1.1.4.  Discovery of layer relationships

   In case the operational mode has already been configured, the host
   device and the controlller need to create the nececessary
   arrangements to navigate from the interface where the router traffic
   is injected up the port connecting to the fiber.  That is, the layer
   hierarchy from L0 to L3 needs to be completed and exposed.

5.1.2.  End-to-end multi-layer event/fault management (valid for both)

   The Target in this use case is to have a full end-to-end multi-layer
   correlation of events at different layers and domains (e.g.
   operational-status changes reported at OTS/OMS/OCh/ODUk (optional),
   IP link level, LSP level, L3VPN/L2VPN level etc.) so that final root
   cause can be quickly identified and fixed (e.g. fibre cut vs coherent
   DWDM pluggable failure).  This use case is divided in two: *
   Correlation of ZR+ connection (OTSi service) operational-status with
   MC/NMC operational-status (‘valid for coherent pluggable) In this
   case, the target is to expose to the MDSC both the events/faults from
   the ZR+ connection (OTSi service) and ZR+ pluggables as well as for
   the MC/NMC associated to this ZR+ connection (OTSi service) in the
   DWDM Line system so that proper correlation can be performed at MDSC
   level * Correlation of coherent pluggable operational status, port
   status, Ethernet link operational status, IP link status

5.1.3.  End-to-end multi-layer performance management (valid for both)

   In this use case, the goal is to have the possibility to analyse
   through performance monitoring of the different layers mentioned
   above and be able, in case of end-to-end L2VPN/L3VPN service
   degradation, to identify the root cause of the degradation.  For
   scaling purposes, the target should be, upon service fulfilment
   phase, to set up the right TCAs associated to each layer that can
   allow to meet the L2VPN/L3VPN service SLA (e.g. in terms of latency,
   jitter, BW, etc.).  This use case is divided in two:

5.1.3.1.  Performance management of the ZR+ connection (OTSi service)
          (‘valid for coherent pluggable)

   Target is to have the basic performance parameters of each OTSi
   service running between two pluggables exposed towards the MDSC.
   Best for operators could be to defined TCA (Threshold crossing
   alerts) from MDSC for each OTSI service and be notified only when the
   Thresholds defined are not met?  Operator shall be able to decide
   which parameters and for which OTSi service.  But all the parameters
   shall be visible if needed by operators.

   Note: Router shall provide also all the possible performance counters
   not only for OTSi service/Ethernet service etc. but also for the
   pluggable itself

   As an example operators should have the ability to get visibility on
   pre-FEC-BER for a given OTSi service and see the trend before post-
   FEC-BER is affected

5.1.3.2.  Performance management of the Ethernet link running over the
          OTSi service and also of the IP link running over this
          Ethernet link.

   TBC

5.2.  Inter-domain link validation (valid for coherent pluggable)

   Documenting the patch cord that connects the port of the coherent
   DWDM pluggable in the routers to the optical node (e.g. to the right
   Add/Drop port of the ROADM) is performed.  This manual operation is
   prone to human mistakes.  It would be highly beneficial for operators
   to have a mean to check/discover that the right pluggable has been
   connected to the desired ROADM port.  This use case requires the
   ability to expose to the MDSC the power levels at coherent DWDM
   pluggable side and at ROADM port side to perform the right
   correlation and validation.

5.3.  End-to-end L3VPN/L2VPN service multi-layer fulfilment with SLA
      constraints (TE constraints) (valid for both)

   This use case is described in [draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-
   applicability] for the SR-TE case which is relevant as target use
   case for operators.  If new connectivity is required between the
   routers and at optical level then full automation could be achieved.
   However considering PMO (Present Mode of Operation) in most
   operators, before an optical path is setup either between two native
   transponders or between two coherent pluggables in routers, a
   detailed optical planning and validation is always required.  So, the
   automation of this use case is considered more for future mode of
   operations (FMO) and has not the same priority as the previous two
   use cases.

5.4.  Pluggable to pluggable service Provisioning

   The following specific coherent DWDM pluggable provisioning sub-cases
   are identified: ### Manual Day 1 configuration (‘valid for coherent
   pluggable) Knowing the coherent pluggable characteristics
   (performance and optical impairments for a specific operational-mode-
   ID), the optical planning and validation process is performed and the
   following parameters are communicated by optical team to IP team:
   nominal-central-frequency, tx-output-power, operational-mode-ID so
   that the coherent pluggables at both ends in the routers can be
   correctly configured in a manual way (e.g. through P-PNC or any other
   mean).  As prerequisite before the coherent pluggable configuration,
   the optical team has properly configured the Media Channel in the
   line system DWDM network through the O-PNC. ### Semi-manual Day 1
   configuration (‘valid for coherent pluggable’) Same optical planning
   and validation is performed first by optical team and then parameters
   are provided to MDSC operations engineer so that they can be set-up
   at Hierarchical SDN controller level and provisioned by P-PNC in the
   corresponding router’s pluggables. ### Semi-Automated Day 1
   configuration with Path Computation API request from MDSC towards PNC
   (‘valid for coherent pluggable’) In this use case the start of the
   pluggable to pluggable connectivity is triggered by the connectivity
   needs of a packet service (slice, vpn, etc...).  In the context of
   ACTC, the process would start with MDSC receiving the service request
   (e.g.  L3VPN) (or service provisioning from a GUI) but a new optical
   connectivity is needed between two ZR/ZR+ pluggables which are
   already physically connected (patch cord) to ROADM nodes ports.  MDSC
   sends a path computation request to the O-PNC asking for a specific
   MC/NMC between source Mux/Dmux and destination Mux/Dmux for a target
   bitrate (e.g. 400G) and O-PNC in coordination with planning tool
   calculates the optical path (after successful PCE computation) for
   this given bitrate (e.g. 400G) with a specific operational-mode-ID
   supported by these coherent pluggables.  It validates the optical
   path defining the central-frequency, output-power, operational-mode-
   ID to be configured in the coherent pluggables.  O-PNC updates the
   MDSC of successful optical path creation exposing this new optical
   path to the MDSC along with the nominal-central-frequency, the
   target-output-power, the operational-mode-ID for which this MC/NMC
   was created, etc.  The optical path is provisioned but operational-
   status is disabled.  The MDSC requests the relevant PNC to configure
   both source and target pluggables with the calculated parameters.
   MDSC uses the coherent pluggable CRUD data model to be used on MPI to
   configure the corresponding ZR+ connection (OTSi service) in the
   source and destination coherent pluggables.  This operation is
   supported by the PNC which will be in charge also to turn-on the
   laser and complete the optical path set-up.  At this point the
   optical path will be moved to operational state and the Packet
   traffic starts to flow. ### Fully automated Day 1 configuration (For
   future discussions)

5.5.  4.  End-to-end L3VPN/L2VPN service multi-layer provisioning with
      SLA constraints (TE constraints) (valid for both)

   This use case is described in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] for the SR-TE case which
   is relevant as target use case for operators.  If new connectivity is
   required between the routers and at optical level then full
   automation could be achieved.  However considering PMO (Present Mode
   of Operation) in most operators, before an optical path is setup
   either between two native transponders or between two coherent
   pluggables in routers, a detailed optical planning and validation is
   always required.  So, the automation of this use case is considered
   more for future mode of operations (FMO) and has not the same
   priority as the previous two use cases.

5.6.  End-to-end L3VPN/L2VPN service multi-layer with SLA constraints
      (TE constraints) with optical restoration support (valid for both
      but here focusing on the coherent pluggable)

   This use case has not the same priority as the previous ones as
   protection in multi-layer Core/Backhaul networks is usually
   implemented at IP layer (e.g.  FRR with RSVP-TE, TI-LFA with SR and
   SR policies in SR-TE) to avoid proven protection races. a.  ZR+ links
   over DWDM network can be considered out of the L0 control plane so
   that no restoration is applied to those links b.  ZR+ links over DWDM
   network can be considered part of the L0 control plane but no
   restoration is enabled for those links c.  ZR+ links over DWDM
   network can be considered as part of the L0 control plane with
   restoration enabled for those links but nominal-central-frequeny is
   maintained unchanged after L0 restoration.  Only output-power could
   be tuned for the new restored path determined by the L0 control plane
   d.  ZR+ links over DWDM network can be considered as part of the L0
   control plane with restoration enabled for those links and nominal-
   central-frequency and output power need to be tuned for the new
   restored path determined by the L0 control plane.
